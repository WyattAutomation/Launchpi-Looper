# Launchpi-Looper
Simple Audio Sample Looping with a Raspberry Pi, and a Novation Launchpad

This is a quick upload of edited example code from https://github.com/eavelardev/novation-launchpad which is based on FMMT666's Launchpad.py that you can find here: https://github.com/FMMT666/launchpad.py

The point of this is to provide code and documentation on setup and usage of Novation Launchpad MIDI controllers with a Raspberry Pi or similar cheap ARM board for looping audio samples in a live music context.  I will update this soon to include installation and useage instructions, as well as additional features. 

##Getting Started

#Install all of the prerequisites for the below repository, and clone it:
https://github.com/eavelardev/novation-launchpad

#Install pygame (if you're using Raspbian Buster, it should already be installed):
https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

#Download and copy clip_looper.py from this repo to the cloned novation_launchpad/examples directory from above

#Edit clip_looper.py for compatiblity with your model of Launchpad

#Wait for me to finish this repo/tutorial if it doesn't work
